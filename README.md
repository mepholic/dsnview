# DSNView
This is a little project I'm working on that includes a library and a frontend
for accessing and viewing live data from NASA's Deep Space Network.

This is current a work-in-progress. I'm using this project to help hone my
development skills in general, but particularly with nodejs.

Feel free to download, use, and contribute to this codebase, but as usual, a
standard disclaimer: If this breaks your code or computer, I take no
responsibility.

## Installation
You will need the following applications and libraries installed to use this:
  * nodejs
  * xml2js (npm)
  * q (npm)
  * node.extend (npm)
  * blessed (npm)

Ideally, you should be able to simply clone this project, enter it's directory,
and run the following command:

    $ npm install

## Usage
You can run the CLI UI with the following from within the project root:

    $ node main.js

The API I'm working on for fetching DSN data is still in a state of flux, so it
is not documented very well.

## Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
